## Planning and Design

Before starting the development process for AthloTix, we carefully planned and designed the application to ensure that it met the needs of our target audience. This involved the following steps:


1. [Identifying Requirements](#identifying-requirements)
2. [Creating User Stories](#creating-user-stories)
3. [Wireframing and Prototyping](#wireframing-and-prototyping)
4. [Architecture and Data Modeling](#architecture-and-data-modeling)

### Identifying Requirements

We started by identifying the requirements for the project, including determining the target audience, defining core features and functionality, and outlining any specific technical requirements. Our target audience consists of coaches and trainers who need to track athlete performance data. Core features include CRUD operations for athlete records.

### Creating User Stories

User stories were created to understand how users would interact with the application. Key use cases were defined, potential pain points were identified, and an intuitive user interface was designed. User actions such as adding, editing, searching, and deleting athletes were mapped out.

### Wireframing and Prototyping

Wireframes and prototypes were developed to visualize the user interface. This step allowed us to make necessary design changes before proceeding to development. A clean and user-friendly interface was designed to facilitate seamless user interactions.

### Architecture and Data Modeling

The application's architecture and data model were carefully planned. Node.js and Express were chosen for the server, MongoDB for the database. The data model includes athlete details such as name, age, gender, sport, and performance data.

## Development

The development of AthloTix involved the following steps:

- [Environment Setup](#environment-setup)
- [Server-Side Code](#server-side-code)
- [User Interface](#user-interface)
- [Integration](#integration)

### Environment Setup

The development environment was set up by installing Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. A Git repository was established for code management, enabling effective collaboration.

### Server-Side Code

Server-side code was written, including routes and handlers for CRUD operations. Connection to the MongoDB database and input validation were implemented to ensure data integrity.

### User Interface

Concurrently with server-side development, the user interface was created using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. The goal was to design a modern and intuitive interface.

### Integration

Server-side code and the user interface were integrated using JavaScript and jQuery. This integration facilitated real-time updates and seamless user interactions.

## Testing and Bug Fixing

Testing and bug fixing were essential throughout the development process:

- [Manual Testing](#manual-testing)
- [Bug Fixing](#bug-fixing)
### Manual Testing

Manual testing was conducted to ensure proper functioning and responsiveness across devices and browsers. Security features and user interactions were thoroughly tested.

### Bug Fixing

Bugs and issues identified during testing were tracked and prioritized. Debugging tools and manual testing were used to resolve these issues promptly.

By prioritizing testing and bug fixing, we created a reliable, secure, and user-friendly CRUD application.

### Technical Analysis

#### User Schema

The project utilizes a user schema that captures user details, including personal information, role (athlete/manager), and authentication data. Passport.js is integrated for secure authentication and authorization.

#### Controllers

Controllers manage user-related and ticket-related operations. The `users.js` controller handles CRUD operations for users, while the `tickets.js` controller manages ticket creation, status updates, and comment addition.

#### User Authentication and Authorization

Passport.js is employed for user authentication, enabling secure login and session management. Different user roles (athlete/manager) are distinguished to grant role-based access.

#### Database Interaction with Mongoose

Mongoose simplifies database operations, providing data validation, modeling, and queries. It ensures data integrity by enforcing predefined rules.

#### Real-time Status Updates and History Tracking

Ticket status changes are recorded using the `history` array in the ticket schema. Each status change is timestamped and associated with the responsible user.

#### Comment System

A comment system allows users to collaborate on tickets. Comments are associated with specific tickets and store user details and timestamps.

#### Responsive Design

The frontend is designed responsively using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and EJS. This ensures a consistent user experience across different devices.

### Additional Technical Aspects

#### RESTful API Design

AthloTix follows RESTful API design principles, ensuring logical and consistent endpoint naming, HTTP methods, and resource representations.

#### Error Handling and Validation

Custom error handling middleware is implemented to provide meaningful error messages and enhance the user experience.

#### Data Security and Privacy

User passwords are hashed and stored securely. Sensitive user data is protected through authentication and authorization mechanisms.

#### Modular Codebase

The project is structured using modular design principles, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

#### Version Control and Collaboration

Git and GitHub are used for version control, enabling effective collaboration, branch management, and conflict resolution.

#### Continuous Integration and Deployment

The project utilizes continuous integration tools to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring code quality and reliability.

#### Documentation

Codebase documentation is provided using comments and README files, promoting code understanding and onboarding for new developers.
